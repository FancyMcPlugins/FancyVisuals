# FancyVisuals

This is a plugin to customise most visual components of your minecraft server. This includes the scoreboard, tablist,
bossbar, actionbar, title and chat. This plugin is highly customisable and can be used to create a unique experience for
your players.
This plugin is packet based (powered by FancySitula), meaning it is blazing fast and has no impact on server
performance. You can use placeholders by PlaceholderAPI anywhere in the plugin.
